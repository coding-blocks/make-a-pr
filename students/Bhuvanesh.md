*****
👨‍🎓 I’m a sophomore student pursuing BCA at 🗺 Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research, Pune. 🏫

🔧 I love technology because it’s the triumph of the human intellect. The more I study and understand technology, the more I feel that nothing in the universe is out of reach. There’s even a great rush of power that comes from coding your first simple “Hello World” program. Getting it to run successfully, seeing those two words on the screen and knowing that YOU put them there just makes you think of the endless possibilities. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. We spread knowledge, make tasks easier, and make systems more efficient. 🐱‍💻

👨‍💻 From my childhood I was fascinated with the tech-world and determined to be a techie one day. Just like singers say music is like Oxygen to them, technology plays a vital role in my life. 🧬
