# About Me
Hi,
I'm **Nikhil Sharma**, a  full-stack javascript Engineer. I love creating scalable and reactive applications with the help of trending libraries and frameworks like React, Node, Angular, Git and some caffeine.

I am an active OSS contributor at various open-source projects like Angular and maintainer @OSSN. Documenting is something I am habitual of, and that's why I blog at Medium. I'm also a speaker at meetups and conferences in India and have given talks at Facebook Developer Circles, React Delhi NCR and JSLovers. I am also the co-creator of create-expo-native-app developed at my internship in BITCS, Gurgaon(https://twitter.com/niksharma1997/status/1152444044376592384).
